[3DIA (3 Dimensional Intelligent Arm) - Final Project, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka](http://localhost:4000/projects/)

Modeling the natural movement of a human hand using artificial neural networks and evolutionary learning algorithms. Goal of this project was to come up with a methodology to incorporate natural behavior into 3D graphics and animations to make those animations more realistic to the human eye. The research is based on the concepts and theories of artificial intelligence such as artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms and learning methodologies.
