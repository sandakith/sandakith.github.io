[TRRuSST - part of TruSSCom (Trustworthy Service Selection and Composition)](http://uniframe.cs.iupui.edu/trusscom/)

The TruSSCom project is aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for design, select and compose trustworthy distributed systems from existing software services using principles of trust models, subjective logic, multi-level specifications and matching, theory of evidence, and continuous testing.Unlike prevalent approaches that focus on one view or a specific application domain, this research is developing a generic model for trust that considers the internal and external views, an associated formalism, and its application to distributed systems.
