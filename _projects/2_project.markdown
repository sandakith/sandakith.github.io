[proURDS - part of UniFrame (Framework for Seamless Integration of Heterogeneous Distributed Components)](http://uniframe.cs.iupui.edu/){:target="\_blank"}


The UniFrame Approach (UA) provides a framework that allows an interoperation of heterogeneous and distributed software components and incorporates the following key concepts: a) a meta-component model (the Unified Meta Model â€“ UMM), b) an integration of QoS at the individual component and distributed system levels, c) the validation and assurance of QoS, based on the concept of event grammars, and e) generative rules, along with their formal specifications, for assembling an ensemble of components out of available choices.
