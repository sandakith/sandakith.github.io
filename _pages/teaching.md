##### Abstract:
This dissertation proposes a framework (TruSStReMark - Trust-based Service Selection and Recommendation for Online Software Marketplaces) to model, quantify, and monitor trust of software services and to perform trust-based service selection and recommendations. It provides methods to analyze and aggregate external reviews, pertaining to specific QoS attributes, of software services by performing subjective logic-based operations. This framework, first, defines trust of a software service using theory of belief and extends the multi-level software specifications to represent the trust-based attributes. It, then, proposes enhancements to two prevalent algorithms for selecting and recommending software services from a marketplace. Finally, the performances of the enhanced selection and recommendation algorithms are improved by parallelizing them. When compared with the prevalent Content-based and Collaborative filtering-based approaches, the results show that, the TruSStReMark is able to produce better results in terms of quality measured using HR (Hit Ratio) and ARHR (Average Reciprocal Hit-Rank) metrics. In addition, the parallelized versions of the trust-based selection and recommendation algorithms improve the end-to-end runtime. The TruSStReMark will enable users to select services, which are trustworthy, from online software marketplaces and use them in composing quality-aware distributed systems.


#### MS (Master of Science)
* Thesis : Design, Development and Experimentation of a Discovery Service with Multi-level Matching
* Major : Computer Science - GPA : 3.92/4.00  - Document : [PDF]()    
* Purdue e-Pubs : [Link](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI1549574/)
* IUPUI ScholarWorks : [Link](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/3695)

##### Abstract:
The contribution of this thesis focuses on addressing the challenges of improving and integrating the URDS and MLM concepts. The objective is to find enhancements for both URDS and MLM and address the need of comprehensive discovery service which go beyond simple attribute based matching. It presents a discussion on developing an enhanced version of URDS with MLM (named as proURDS) and deploy it in a distributed setup. The proposed solution is validated using a publically available dataset under different experimental configurations. The UniFrame Resource Discovery Service (URDS) is a previously proposed approach for discovery of the services that are deployed over the network. Due to the limitations of the simple attribute based representation of service contracts and basic textual matching, the URDS proposed the concepts of Multi-level contract representation and Multi-level Matching (MLM). The URDS was previously experimented with simulations.
